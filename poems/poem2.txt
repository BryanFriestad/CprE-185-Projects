The Robot by Robot

war is like a adamant lock


and the beach, it is linking
voracious: a breeze feels like a tombstone, voracious
act is like a voracious apparatus
blue: an addiction feels like a sun, blue
wall? no, we all expound...

the wall manipulates
lock is like a contumacious bird
actress
sage is like a withering walker
tombstone is like a lonely vessel
vessel is like a risible war
trade is like a limpid heart
