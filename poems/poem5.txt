The Robot by Robot

withering: a death feels like a lock, withering
and the tramp, it is configureing
and the satellite, it is justifying
satellite is like a tenacious moon
beach is like a risible anxiety
and the breath, it is instructing
the safety ironizes
war is like a adamant anxiety
nefarious: a sun feels like an affair, nefarious
the war descends

pretty: a wheelchair feels like a plane, pretty
war is like a blue wall
the valley detects
and the death, it is positioning
