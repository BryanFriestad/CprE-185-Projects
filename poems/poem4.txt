The Robot by Robot

anxiety is like a hubristic sun
moon is like a amatory lung
toilet is like a risible tear
the trade persuades
the beach maintains
and the act, it is configureing
the captain justifys
voracious: an act feels like a breath, voracious
the bird problematizes
the toilet links
and the crutch, it is illuminateing

breeze is like a blue tramp
lock is like a hubristic tombstone
the safety denounces
bus is like a mendacious walker
battle is like a risible apparatus
